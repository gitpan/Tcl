Revision history for Perl extension Tcl.

0.7     02-jul-2003, Vadim Konovalov
        - Some possible coredumps were fixed (but not completely, hence FIXME
          warning in Tcl.xs)
        - some fixes from Slaven Rezic, (FreeBSD support and some more)
        - perl-5.005 support (FreeBSD has this version after installation)

0.6     08-jun-2003, Vadim Konovalov
        - now Tcl 'is-a' Tcl::Tk
        - improved access method for TCL Events (%y, %y and so on)
        - WinCE support

	  (perl-5.6.0, perl-5.8.0, tcl-8.4.2)
	- call to Tcl_FindExecutable, as long as Tcl now requires this
	  (otherwise Tcl dumps core, as RTFS-ing of Tcl shows)
	- XS function "Tcl::call" renamed to "Tcl::icall" and "Tcl::call"
	  implemented in Tcl.pm and now contains more complex logic.
	- sub create_tcl_sub and ev_sub were added, they could be used
	  to create event fields-aware subroutines
	- added 'tclcfg.tcl' to output tcl configuration, used from Makefile.PL
	- Makefile.PL changed to be more consistent
	- use strict;
