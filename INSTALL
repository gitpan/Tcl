This extension is designed to build in the standard way for perl5
extensions:

1. Extract the distribution anywhere *away* from the perl5 source tree.

2. Change directory to the top of this hierarchy (....../Tcl).

3. Tweak Makefile.PL if necessary--if your Tcl include files are neither
in /usr/local/include nor in /usr/include/tcl then put the appropriate
path in the INC line.

4. Type
    perl Makefile.PL

5. To build as a dynamic extension, if your platform supports it, type
    make
although a problem with OSF/1 make makes it necessary instead to type
    make dynamic
To build a perl executable in the current directory which is statically
linked with this extension type
    make perl
If you want to build a static perl with more extensions, use the makeaperl
script that comes with the perl5 distribution.

6. To run the small suite of tests, type
    make test
