The Tcl extension provides a small but complete interface into libtcl
and any other Tcl-based library. It lets you create Tcl interpreters
(as perl5 objects), bind in commands to them (either perl subroutines
or C functions dynamically loaded with the DynaLoader extension) and
execute Tcl code in those interpreters. There is a Tcl::Tk extension
(not to be confused with "native" perl5 Perl/Tk extension) distributed
separately which provides a raw but complete interface to the whole of
libtk via this Tcl extension.

Build in the usual way for a perl extension:

1. Tweak Makefile.PL is necessary only if your Tcl include files could
not be found automatically by Makefile.PL script. Normally you just make
sure you have right tcl in your path at a moment of running Makefile.PL
script.

2. perl Makefile.PL
   make

3. Before installing, you can run the small test suite with
    make test
if you wish.

4.  make install

In rare case when you do cross-compiling for WinCE, you need to edit and
use ceMakefile.PL
