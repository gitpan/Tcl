This is the beta1 release of the Tcl extension module for Perl5. You
need to have at least release 5.001 of Perl because the installation
of this extension uses features of ExtUtils::MakeMaker which only work
properly as of that release.

The Tcl extension provides a small but complete interface into libtcl
and any other Tcl-based library. It lets you create Tcl interpreters
(as perl5 objects), bind in commands to them (either perl subroutines
or C functions dynamically loaded with the DynaLoader extension) and
execute Tcl code in those interpreters. There is a Tcl::Tk extension
(not to be confused with "native" perl5 Tk extension) distributed
separately which provides a raw but complete interface to the whole of
libtk via this Tcl extension.
