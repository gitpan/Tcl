This is the beta2 release of the Tcl extension module for Perl5. You
need to have at least release 5.002 of Perl.

The Tcl extension provides a small but complete interface into libtcl
and any other Tcl-based library. It lets you create Tcl interpreters
(as perl5 objects), bind in commands to them (either perl subroutines
or C functions dynamically loaded with the DynaLoader extension) and
execute Tcl code in those interpreters. There is a Tcl::Tk extension
(not to be confused with "native" perl5 Perl/Tk extension) distributed
separately which provides a raw but complete interface to the whole of
libtk via this Tcl extension.

Build in the usual way for a perl extension:

1. Tweak Makefile.PL is necessary--if your Tcl include files are
neither in /usr/local/include nor in /usr/include/tcl then put the
appropriate path in the INC line.

2. perl Makefile.PL
   make

3. Before installing, you can run the small test suite with
    make test
if you wish.

4.  make install
